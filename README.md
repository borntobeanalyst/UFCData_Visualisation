# UFCData_Visualisation
I have conducted various data visualisation to have a better understanding of the life cycle of UFC and its fighters.
By creating different types of visualisations, I could make a clear insight for the UFC games and suggest a possbility to monetise the analysis of the data.

The project includes clustering analysis, mapping, heatmap analysis etc.
